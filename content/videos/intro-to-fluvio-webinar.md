Fluvio is an open-source data streaming platform with in-line computation capabilities. It's distributed stream processing with redundancy and failover, prevents data loss and minimize downtime. Programmable stream processing is used to clean, transform, correlate, and derive insights from data in real-time. Fluvio’s performance, scalability, deployment flexibility, and programmability allow building the data-in-motion infrastructure of the future.
