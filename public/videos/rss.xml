      <title>Rust in 100 Seconds</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1315/videos/rust-in-100-seconds/</link>

      <description>InfinyOn Cloud is built on Rust which is blazingly fast and memory-efficent. It has the simplicity of high-level languages (Go, Python), but the control of low-level languages (C, C++). With no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages. Rust has a rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.</description>
