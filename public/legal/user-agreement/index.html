</li>
<li>
<p>INDEMNIFICATION</p>
<p>7.1 <ins>By InfinyOn</ins>. Subject to liability limitations set forth in Section 8, Infinyon will: (a) defend Customer against any third party claim that the Cloud Service infringes any trademark or copyright of such third party, enforceable in the jurisdiction of Customer’s use of the Cloud Service, or misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that such misappropriation is not a result of Customer’s actions) (“Infringement Claim”); and (b) indemnify Customer against and pay any settlement of such Infringement Claim consented to by InfinyOn or any damages finally awarded against Customer to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction. InfinyOn will have no obligation and assumes no liability under this Section 7 or otherwise with respect to any claim to the extent based on: (a) operation or use of the Cloud Service with any Customer Data or any Customer or third party products, services, hardware, data, content, or business processes not provided by InfinyOn where there would be no Infringement Claim but for such combination; (b) use of the Cloud Service other than in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Documentation; or (c) Customer’s or any Authorized User’s use of the Cloud Service other than as permitted under this Agreement. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH INFINYON’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS.</p>
<p>7.2 <ins>Remedies</ins>. Should the Cloud Service become, or in InfinyOn&rsquo;s opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim, InfinyOn may, at its option (a) procure for Customer the right to use the Cloud Service in accordance with this Agreement; (b) replace or modify, the Cloud Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate Customer’s right to use the Cloud Service and discontinue the related Support Services.</p>
<p>7.3 <ins>By Customer</ins>.

<p>7.4 <ins>Indemnity Process</ins>. Each Party’s indemnification obligations are conditioned on the indemnified party: (a) promptly giving written notice of the claim to the indemnifying Party; (b) giving the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) providing to the indemnifying Party all available information and assistance in connection with the claim, at the indemnifying Party’s request and expense. The indemnified Party may participate in the defense of the claim, at the indemnified Party’s sole expense (not subject to reimbursement). Neither Party may admit liability for or consent to any judgment or concede or settle or compromise any claim unless such admission or concession or settlement or compromise includes a full and unconditional release of the other Party from all liabilities in respect of such claim.</p>
</li>
<li>

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, THE ECONOMIC TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GENERAL</p>
<p>9.1 <ins>Assignment</ins>. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether by operation of law or otherwise, to any third party without the other party’s prior written consent, except to an Affiliate or to any successor to its business or assets to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, reorganization or otherwise.

<p>9.4 <ins>Non-waiver</ins>.

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law by a court of competent jurisdiction, it will be replaced with the valid provision that most closely reflects the intent of the Parties and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>9.7 <ins>Relationship of the Parties</ins>. Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as creating an agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between the Parties hereto. Neither Party has any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other Party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever. Each Party may identify the other as a customer or supplier, as applicable.</p>
<p>9.8 <ins>Export Compliance</ins>. InfinyOn Materials are subject to export control laws and regulations. Customer may not access or use the InfinyOn Materials or any underlying information or technology except in full compliance with all applicable United States export control laws. Neither the InfinyOn Technology nor any underlying information or technology may be accessed or used (a) by any individual or entity in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) by anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of specially designated nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s list of prohibited countries or debarred or denied persons or entities.</p>
<p>9.9 <ins>Government Restricted Rights</ins>. If InfinyOn Software is being licensed by the U.S. Government, the InfinyOn Software is deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer documentation” developed exclusively at private expense, and (a) if acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency, shall be subject solely to the terms of this computer software license as specified in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its successors; and (b) if acquired by or on behalf of units of the Department of Defense (“DOD”) shall be subject to the terms of this commercial computer software license as specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-2, DOD FAR Supplement and its successors.</p>
<p>9.10 <ins>Execution</ins>. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between Customer and InfinyOn, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous proposals, quotes, negotiations, discussions, or agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties regarding its subject matter. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any other document referenced in this Agreement, this Agreement will control. Any preprinted terms on any Customer ordering documents or terms referenced or linked therein will have no effect on the terms of this Agreement and are hereby rejected, including where such Customer ordering document is signed by InfinyOn. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which taken together form one binding legal instrument. The Parties hereby consent to the use of electronic signatures in connection with the execution of this Agreement, and further agree that electronic signatures to this Agreement will be legally binding with the same force and effect as manually executed signatures.</p>
