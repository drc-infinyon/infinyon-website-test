### Overview

This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains how Infinyon, Inc., and subsidiaries (collectively, “Infinyon”, “we”, “us” or “our”) use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit one of our websites, including any other media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application related or connected thereto provided or officially sponsored by Infinyon, or any other Infinyon websites that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Websites”).

This Policy explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as our users’ (“data subject”, “user”, “you” or “your”) rights to control our use of them.

In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. In such cases, our [Privacy Policy]({{<relref "privacy.md" >}}) will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are created when you visit a website that uses cookies to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, and any preferences. Websites store a corresponding file to the one that is set in your browser, and in this file websites track and keep information on your movements within the site, and any information you may voluntarily give while visiting the website, such as email address.

### Why do we use cookies?

We use cookies for several reasons, such as to provide you with a consistent and customized experience on our Websites. Like most organizations, we also partner with selected third parties, listed below, for tracking and marketing purposes on our Websites; these cookies enable us to analyze and track the use of our Websites, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.

You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these third parties and contact them directly for responses to your questions.

Analytics services enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites, and keep track of page traffic and user behavior while browsing the site.

### Social networking cookies

By accessing social networks or using social features of our Websites, these social networking services or providers may set additional cookies, which may be used to track your browsing activity. We do not have control over these cookies. You are encouraged to review the relevant privacy and cookie policies for each respective social network provider to ensure you are comfortable with their data privacy practices. To opt-out, please refer to each respective social network provider. Additional resources may be found in the “How can I control cookies?” section of this policy.

### What about other tracking technologies?

In addition to cookies, we use other tracking technologies like tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is an HTML code snippet which is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email. It is useful for tracking user behavior and conversions. We use tracking pixels to monitor the traffic patterns of our users, to understand if you have clicked on an ad displayed on a third-party website, improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair this functionality. Personal information collected using tracking pixels is stored and analyzed by us to optimize the delivery of our newsletters and emails, and to improve the relevance of the distributed content. Many email clients and web browsers support functionality to opt-out or prevent the use of these tracking mechanisms.

### How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can set or amend your Internet browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites, though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. Please visit your browser’s help menu for information on how to opt-out of cookies. Tracking pixels may be refused by configuring the settings on your email client or web browser to prevent web beacons from being activated. Please refer to the documentation for your particular web browser, email client or device for additional information on whether it is supported and how to configure this setting. For additional information regarding our privacy practices and how we protect your personal information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

#### A special note on Do-Not-Track signals

Modern web browsers and mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature; however, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our Websites. If a universal standard for responding to DNT signals is adopted in the future, we will update this Cookie Policy to reflect such practices.

### How often will you update this Cookie Policy?
We may update this Cookie Policy periodically to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please review this Cookie Policy to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies and your choices.
