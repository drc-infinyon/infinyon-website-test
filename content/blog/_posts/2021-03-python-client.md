This week, we're happy to announce the addition of a [Python client library for Fluvio].
Using the Python client is just as easy as using our other clients. Check out the
[hello world in Python tutorial] or [documentation] for usage.

[Python client library for Fluvio]: https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-client-python
[hello world in Python tutorial]: https://www.fluvio.io/api/official/python/examples/
[documentation]: https://infinyon.github.io/fluvio-client-python/fluvio.html

In this post, we'll talk about how we were able to leverage some of the great
Rust tools to build a Python client without writing much Python itself.

## Overview

In short, we will:

- use [flapigen] to define how our Rust structs will go across the FFI.
- use the [rust-cpython] extension in our Python project and call it.

[flapigen]: https://github.com/Dushistov/flapigen-rs
[rust-cpython]: https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython

## Setup

To get started, we'll create a new project folder that's set up for both
Rust and Python, using `cargo` and `venv`.

%copy%

```bash
cargo new --lib my-python-lib
cd my-python-lib
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

The above creates a Rust crate named `my-python-lib`, then sets-up a Python
[virtual environment].

-> **Note**: You'll need to have the [rust toolchain] and [python 3.6] or above installed.

[virtual environment]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
[rust toolchain]: https://rustup.rs/
[python 3.6]: https://www.python.org/downloads/


## Rust glue

We'll need to add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

%copy%

```bash
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cpython = { version = "0.5", features = ["extension-module"] }

[build-dependencies]
flapigen = "0.6.0-pre7"
```

The `crate-type = ["cdylib"]` tells Rust to build our crate as a C-compatible
[dynamic library] rather than a typical crate. This crate type will allow our Python code
to interact with our library as if it were compiled C code rather than Rust.

[dynamic library]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker

Now we'll create a [build script] in `build.rs` by adding the following:

%copy%

```rust
use flapigen::{LanguageConfig, PythonConfig};
use std::{env, path::Path};

fn main() {
    let in_src = Path::new("src").join("glue.rs.in");
    let out_dir = env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap();
    let out_src = Path::new(&out_dir).join("glue.rs");

    let python_cfg = PythonConfig::new("my_python_lib".to_owned());
    let flap_gen =
        flapigen::Generator::new(LanguageConfig::PythonConfig(python_cfg)).rustfmt_bindings(true);
    flap_gen.expand("python bindings", &in_src, &out_src);
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={}", in_src.display());
}
```

The code sets up `flapigen` to run on our project. At build time,
it will read the "glue code" we write in `src/glue.rs.in`, and generate
Rust code to interact with Python and place it in `${OUT_DIR}/glue.rs`.

Now we'll add a `src/glue.rs.in` file with something like the following:

%copy%

```rust
pub struct Foo {
    val: i32
}
impl Foo {
    pub fn new(val: i32) -> Self {
        Self {
            val
        }
    }
    pub fn set_field(&mut self, new_val: i32) {
        self.val = new_val;
    }
    pub fn val(&self) -> i32 {
        self.val
    }
}
foreign_class!(class Foo {
    self_type Foo;
    constructor Foo::new(_: i32) -> Foo;
    fn Foo::set_field(&mut self, _: i32);
    fn Foo::val(&self) -> i32;
});
```

This simple example was published in the [flapigen book] and we can copy and paste it here.

[flapigen book]: https://dushistov.github.io/flapigen-rs/foreign-class.html
[build script]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html

The `src/lib.rs` should currently have some basic tests. We'll change it to the following:

%copy%

```rust
#![allow(non_snake_case, unused)]

include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/glue.rs"));
```

This is a typical Rust pattern when using build scripts. The code takes the
file in `${OUT_DIR}/glue.rs` and includes the contents into `src/lib.rs` in the
build directory. The result will be as if we hand-wrote the generated code in
our `lib.rs` file.

This section uses flapigen to expand the [`foreign_class`] macro into many
[cpython] functions as an [extension module], and cargo compiles it as a
[`cdylib`]. If you want to see what that looks like, install [`cargo-expand`]
and run `cargo expand`. You'll get a lot of generated rust code.

## Python Glue

In the [`setup`](#setup), we created a virtual environment, and now we'll need to
install some Python tools via:

%copy first-line%

```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate && pip install setuptools-rust
```

Now to create a python package, you create a file called `setup.py` with:

%copy%

```python
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools_rust import Binding, RustExtension

setup(
    name="my-python-lib",
    version="1.0",
    rust_extensions=[RustExtension("my_python_lib", binding=Binding.RustCPython)],
    # rust extensions are not zip safe, just like C-extensions.
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

This is the most basic [setuptools-rust] setup, except for using
[`RustCPython`] as the binding.

[setuptools-rust]: https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust#setuppy
[`RustCPython`]: https://setuptools-rust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#setuptools_rust.Binding

To build the Rust and the Python packages just run `python setup.py develop`.
Python calls `cargo` and moves `cdylib` into your local directory.

## Testing it all out

Create a `simple.py` script with the following in it:

%copy%

```python
from my_python_lib import Foo
foo = Foo(1)
print(foo.val())
foo.set_field(11)
print(foo.val())
```

Running the script via `python simple.py` should result in:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ python simple.py
1
11
```

And there you go, you've called Rust from Python!

These are just the basics for setting up a Python wrapper. In the Fluvio Python Client, the Rust crate is [`_fluvio_python`]; a private python module that wraps the rust structs with python classes, giving us nice [documentation generation].
