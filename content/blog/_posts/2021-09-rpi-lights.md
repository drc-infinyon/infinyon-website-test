[Raspberry Pi] is a versatile low-cost computer ideal for prototyping IoT projects such as air quality monitors, water level sensors, autonomous irrigation systems, surveillance cameras, face recognition robots, home automation, and many more. The Raspberry Pi is easy to connect to your home network but quite challenging to connect and control from the Cloud.

This tutorial will show how to connect Raspberry Pi to [InfinyOn Cloud] - a high-performance, distributed, programmable streaming platform. Once connected, you can use InfinyOn Cloud or a [Fluvio] client anywhere in the world to communicate with your device. In addition, this blog will show the ability to control a mini traffic light in real-time.

-> This blog is the first of the IoT series. Future blogs will describe how to build an IoT aggregator for many devices using InfinyOn Cloud.

All message exchanges between your Raspberry Pi and the Cloud are encrypted to ensure privacy and security.

## Prerequisites

This blog assumes you have an InfinyOn Cloud account and access to a Raspberry Pi device and a Pi traffic light. As a substitute for the traffic light, you could [wire up an LED] on the breadboard.

* **InfinyOn Cloud Account** - create a free [account here].
* **Raspberry Pi** - this tutorial uses [Model B+] (other models not tested but expected to work).
  * The device must run [Ubuntu 20.04 TLS (32 bit) OS] or above.
* **Pi Traffic Light** - available for [purchase here].

## Check Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi should be running `Ubuntu`, `python3` and `pip3`. To check run the following commands:

```bash
$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu 5.8.0-1011-raspi #14-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Tue Dec 15 08:58:13 UTC 2020 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux

$ python3 -V
Python 3.8.10

$ pip3 -V
pip 21.2.4 from /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

We are using python to control the GPIO pins that turns the lights on and off.

## Connect the Traffic Lights

Now it's time to work on the hardware. First, we'll connect the traffic lights to the Raspberry Pi and ensure they are in working order.

The nice thing about the traffic lights component is that we can directly insert it into the Raspberry Pi pins.

<img src="/blog/images/rpi-lights/pinout.png"
     alt="Raspberry Pi Pins"
     style="margin: auto; max-width: 600px" />

Just make sure the lights face outwards.


#### Test the Lights

As the traffic lights are controlled through GPIO pins, we need to install a package called `gpiozero`:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```

It's time to write some code. Create a file called `lights.py` and paste the following code:

%copy%

```python
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep

class Lights:
    def __init__(self):
        self.red = LED(9)
        self.yellow = LED(10)
        self.green = LED(11)

    def go(self):
        self.off()
        self.green.on()

    def stop(self):
        self.off()
        self.yellow.on()
        sleep(1)
        self.yellow.off()
        self.red.on()

    def on(self):
        self.red.on()
        self.yellow.on()
        self.green.on()

    def off(self):
        self.red.off()
        self.yellow.off()
        self.green.off()


def main():
    lights = Lights()

    lights.go()
    sleep(1)
    lights.stop()
    sleep(1)

    for x in range(5):
        sleep(.5)
        lights.on()
        sleep(.5)
        lights.off()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The code has several routines to control the GPIO pins corresponding to ***red***, ***yellow***, and ***green***â€” each routine is followed by a sleep statement that keeps the lights on for a short time.

To execute the code, run:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ python3 lights.py
```

Let's see it in action:

</video>

Very cool, the lights are working corretly.


## Installing Fluvio Client

You'll need to download and install the CLI.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

This command will download the Fluvio Version Manager (fvm), Fluvio CLI (fluvio) and config files into `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executables in `$HOME/.fluvio/bin`. To complete the installation, you will need to add the executables to your shell `$PATH`.

Check the version to make sure everything is working correctly:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio version
```

As expected, the client is not yet associated with a cluster. We'll do that next.


## Setup InfinyOn Cloud

InfinyOn Cloud is the intermediation point between your Raspberry Pi and any other devices (cloud or local). Let's create an account and login with Fluvio client.

#### Create a free InfinyOn Cloud

Signup at <a href="https://infinyon.cloud/singup" target="_blank">https://infinyon.cloud/signup</a>.


#### Login with Fluvio Client

In Raspberry Pi, at the terminal,  type the following command:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio cloud login
Infinyon Cloud email: ...
Password: ...
```

Fluvio Client establishes a connection with InfinyOn Cloud and downloads your profile. The profile has your TLS settings to ensure message exchanges are encrypted.

Let's make sure the client can communicate with the cluster in the cloud. Add a `topic` called `lights`:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio topic create lights
topic "lights" created
```

Congratulations, your Raspberry Pi is now connected to the cloud.


## Install `fluvio-python-client`

We want to control our light programmatically from our Python code. To accomplish this, we need to install the python native fluvio client.

On **Raspberry Pi 2/3**, download `linux_armv7l`:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ pip3 install https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-client-python/releases/download/v0.9.5/fluvio-0.9.5-cp38-cp38-linux_armv7l.whl
```

For **Pi Zero**, download `linux_armv6l`:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ pip3 install https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-client-python/releases/download/v0.9.5/fluvio-0.9.5-cp38-cp38-linux_armv6l.whl
```


## Update `lights.py` file

Next, we'll update the python file from to listen to events from fluvio:

%copy%

{{< highlight rust "hl_lines=3 36-53" >}}
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep
from fluvio import (Fluvio, Offset)

class Lights:
    def __init__(self):
        self.red = LED(9)
        self.yellow = LED(10)
        self.green = LED(11)

    def go(self):
        self.off()
        self.green.on()

    def stop(self):
        self.off()
        self.yellow.on()
        sleep(1)
        self.yellow.off()
        self.red.on()

    def on(self):
        self.red.on()
        self.yellow.on()
        self.green.on()

    def off(self):
        self.red.off()
        self.yellow.off()
        self.green.off()


def main():
    lights = Lights()

    fluvio = Fluvio.connect()
    print("connected to fluvio")

    consumer = fluvio.partition_consumer("lights", 0)
    print("retrieved consumer")

    for i in consumer.stream(Offset.end()):
        value = i.value_string()
        print("received: %s" % value)

        if value == "go":
            lights.go()
        elif value == "stop":
            lights.stop()
        elif value == "on":
            lights.on()
        elif value == "off":
            lights.off()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
{{< /highlight >}}

The code changes are as follows:

* import ***Fluvio*** and ***Offset*** from the fluvio python client.
* extablish a connection to ***InfinyOn Cloud***.
* open a ***consumer stream*** that listens on ***lights*** topic on partition ***0***.
* for every known command ***go***, ***stop***, ***on***, ***off***, call the light routine.

Let's restart the program.

-> Note: Use &lt;CTRL&gt;-\ to break out of the program as &lt;CTRL&gt;-C is not yet implemented

Run the new code:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ python3 lights.py
connected to fluvio
retrieved consumer
```


## Control Raspberry Pi from InfinyOn Cloud

Open the web browser at [https://infinyon.cloud](https://infinyon.cloud), and navigate to ***lights*** topic.
In the record field, type ***go***, ***stop*** and watch the lights change:

<video controls>
  <source src="/blog/images/rpi-lights/lights-demo.mp4">
</video>

Congratulations, your Raspberry Pi is connected to the Cloud!


## Control Raspberry Pi from Fluvio CLI

You can also use `fluvio cli` to remotely contol the device.

-> Note: Make sure that your cli is connected to the cloud.

In the terminal type:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ fluvio produce lights
> go
Ok!
> stop
Ok!
> on
Ok!
> off
Ok!
>
```

Fluvio supports any number of producers and consumers, which enables your Raspberry to be control with multiple producers at the same time.


## Conclusion

The blog is an introductory tutorial on how to connect and manage Raspberry Pi from the Cloud. Fluvio and InfinyOn Cloud has many more feature that can help you manage multiple topics and edge devices in parallel.
