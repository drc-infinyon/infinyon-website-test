## Role 
We’re looking for self-motivated team members who crave a challenge and feel energized to roll up their sleeves and help realize InfinyOn’s enormous potential. Chart your own path and take healthy risks as we solve big problems together. 

InfinyOn Cloud, built on Fluvio OSS, delivers a complete end-to-end event streaming experience via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Moving data multiple times between databases, microservices, and analytics tools is expensive and complicated. InfinyOn intelligent data pipelines bundle data streaming and in-line SmartModule processing in one product allowing vendors to deploy and operate microservices directly on the pipeline. The InfinyOn approach eliminates infrastructure complexity and operational overhead for out-of-band microservices and reduces the need for excessive data movement. 

The Head of Product is directly responsible for working with Cloud customers and the open source community to understand requirements and craft a roadmap that brings InfinyOn to the forefront of the intelligent data streaming market. The ideal candidate can synthesize many use cases and prioritize features based on vision, effort, and market opportunity. In addition, they will work closely with sales, marketing, and engineering teams to facilitate transparency, fast decision-making, and smooth collaboration.
